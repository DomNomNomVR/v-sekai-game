In Godot Engine 4.0, you can create a method to iteratively tighten up to 10 Kusudamas per bone for the T-pose and loosen the constraints when the animation is played using the Skeleton3D node and AnimationPlayer node. To constraint the forward axis twist from a range, you can modify the `tighten_kusudama_constraints()` method. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. First, create a new script attached to a Node3D or any other suitable node in your scene.

```gdscript
extends Node3D

# Declare variables
onready var skeleton = $Skeleton3D
onready var animation_player = $AnimationPlayer
var t_pose_constraints = []
const MAX_KUSUDAMAS_PER_BONE = 10
```

2. Next, define a method to store the initial Kusudama constraints for each bone in the T-pose.

```gdscript
func store_t_pose_constraints():
    for i in range(skeleton.get_bone_count()):
        var bone_name = skeleton.get_bone_name(i)
        var bone_transform = skeleton.get_bone_global_pose(i)
        t_pose_constraints.append({
            "name": bone_name,
            "transform": bone_transform
        })
```

3. Define a method to tighten the Kusudama constraints based on the current pose.

```gdscript
func tighten_kusudama_constraints():
    for constraint in t_pose_constraints:
        var bone_idx = skeleton.find_bone(constraint["name"])
        var current_transform = skeleton.get_bone_global_pose(bone_idx)
        var target_transform = constraint["transform"].interpolate_with(current_transform, 0.5)
        
        # Apply up to MAX_KUSUDAMAS_PER_BONE times
        for _i in range(MAX_KUSUDAMAS_PER_BONE):
            # Constraint the forward axis twist
            var forward_axis_twist = target_transform.basis.get_euler().x
            var min_twist = deg2rad(-45)  # Set your minimum twist angle in degrees
            var max_twist = deg2rad(45)   # Set your maximum twist angle in degrees
            
            if forward_axis_twist < min_twist:
                forward_axis_twist = min_twist
            elif forward_axis_twist > max_twist:
                forward_axis_twist = max_twist
                
            target_transform.basis.set_euler(Vector3(forward_axis_twist, target_transform.basis.get_euler().y, target_transform.basis.get_euler().z))
            
            skeleton.set_bone_global_pose_override(bone_idx, target_transform, 1.0, true)
```

4. Define a method to reset the Kusudama constraints to their original state.

```gdscript
func reset_kusudama_constraints():
    for constraint in t_pose_constraints:
        var bone_idx = skeleton.find_bone(constraint["name"])
        skeleton.set_bone_global_pose_override(bone_idx, constraint["transform"], 0.0, true)
```

5. Finally, connect the `animation_started` and `animation_finished` signals from the AnimationPlayer node to your script.

```gdscript
func _ready():
    store_t_pose_constraints()
    animation_player.connect("animation_started", self, "tighten_kusudama_constraints")
    animation_player.connect("animation_finished", self, "reset_kusudama_constraints")
```

This example demonstrates how to tighten up to 10 Kusudamas per bone when an animation starts playing and reset them when the animation finishes while constraining the forward axis twist within a specified range. You can adjust the interpolation factor in the `tighten_kusudama_constraints()` method to control the tightness of the constraints.


If you want to merge the areas of the sphere of the Kusudama spherical rotation in a non-greedy approach, you can use an optimization algorithm to find the best combination of Kusudama constraints that minimize the overall error. One such optimization algorithm is the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

Here's an outline of how you can implement this approach in Godot Engine 4.0:

1. Create a new script attached to a Node3D or any other suitable node in your scene.

```gdscript
extends Node3D

# Declare variables
onready var skeleton = $Skeleton3D
onready var animation_player = $AnimationPlayer
var t_pose_constraints = []
const MAX_KUSUDAMAS_PER_BONE = 10
```

2. Define a method to store the initial Kusudama constraints for each bone in the T-pose.

```gdscript
func store_t_pose_constraints():
    # Same as before
```

3. Implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to find the optimal combination of Kusudama constraints.

```gdscript
func pso_algorithm():
    # Initialize particles, velocities, and personal bests
    # Set global best to an initial value
    
    # Iterate until a stopping condition is met:
        # For each particle:
            # Update its position based on its velocity
            # Calculate the fitness (error) of the new position
            # Update the personal best if the new fitness is better
            # Update the global best if the new fitness is better
        
        # For each particle:
            # Update its velocity based on personal best and global best
```

4. Modify the `tighten_kusudama_constraints()` method to use the PSO algorithm results.

```gdscript
func tighten_kusudama_constraints():
    # Run the PSO algorithm to find the optimal combination of Kusudama constraints
    pso_algorithm()
    
    # Apply the optimal combination of Kusudama constraints to the skeleton
```

5. Define a method to reset the Kusudama constraints to their original state.

```gdscript
func reset_kusudama_constraints():
    # Same as before
```

6. Connect the `animation_started` and `animation_finished` signals from the AnimationPlayer node to your script.

```gdscript
func _ready():
    store_t_pose_constraints()
    animation_player.connect("animation_started", self, "tighten_kusudama_constraints")
    animation_player.connect("animation_finished", self, "reset_kusudama_constraints")
```

This approach uses the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to find the best combination of Kus

Yes, you can treat each limit cone constraint as a particle in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Each particle will represent a possible configuration of Kusudama constraints for a bone. The position of a particle in the search space corresponds to the parameters of the limit cone constraints, such as the twist angle and swing angles.

Here's how you can modify the PSO algorithm to work with limit cone constraints:

1. Initialize particles, velocities, and personal bests for each bone's limit cone constraint.

```gdscript
func initialize_pso():
    # Initialize particles, velocities, and personal bests for each bone's limit cone constraint
```

2. Update the position of each particle based on its velocity.

```gdscript
func update_particle_positions():
    # For each particle:
        # Update its position based on its velocity
```

3. Calculate the fitness (error) of the new position by measuring how well the Kusudama constraints are satisfied.

```gdscript
func calculate_fitness(particle_position):
    # Calculate the fitness (error) of the new position
    # Fitness could be the sum of squared differences between the current and target angles
```

4. Update the personal best and global best if the new fitness is better.

```gdscript
func update_personal_and_global_bests():
    # For each particle:
        # Update the personal best if the new fitness is better
        # Update the global best if the new fitness is better
```

5. Update the velocity of each particle based on personal best and global best.

```gdscript
func update_particle_velocities():
    # For each particle:
        # Update its velocity based on personal best and global best
```

6. Modify the `tighten_kusudama_constraints()` method to use the PSO algorithm results.

```gdscript
func tighten_kusudama_constraints():
    # Run the PSO algorithm to find the optimal combination of Kusudama constraints
    pso_algorithm()
    
    # Apply the optimal combination of Kusudama constraints to the skeleton
```

By treating each limit cone constraint as a particle, you can use the PSO algorithm to search for the best combination of Kusudama constraints that minimize the overall error. This approach allows you to optimize the constraints in a non-greedy manner.

Certainly! Here's a concise version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in GDScript:

```gdscript
extends Node

const NUM_PARTICLES = 10
const MAX_ITERATIONS = 100
const INERTIA_WEIGHT = 0.7
const COGNITIVE_WEIGHT = 1.4
const SOCIAL_WEIGHT = 1.4

var particles = []
var velocities = []
var personal_bests = []
var global_best = null
var global_best_fitness = INF

func _ready():
    initialize_pso()
    pso_algorithm()

func initialize_pso():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        var particle = random_particle_position()
        particles.append(particle)
        velocities.append(Vector2.ZERO)
        personal_bests.append(particle)

        var fitness = calculate_fitness(particle)
        if fitness < global_best_fitness:
            global_best_fitness = fitness
            global_best = particle

func pso_algorithm():
    for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
        update_particle_positions()
        update_personal_and_global_bests()
        update_particle_velocities()

func random_particle_position():
    return Vector2(rand_range(-1, 1), rand_range(-1, 1))

func update_particle_positions():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        particles[i] += velocities[i]

func calculate_fitness(particle_position):
    # Calculate the fitness (error) of the new position
    # Fitness could be the sum of squared differences between the current and target angles
    return pow(particle_position.x, 2) + pow(particle_position.y, 2)

func update_personal_and_global_bests():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        var fitness = calculate_fitness(particles[i])
        if fitness < calculate_fitness(personal_bests[i]):
            personal_bests[i] = particles[i]
        
        if fitness < global_best_fitness:
            global_best_fitness = fitness
            global_best = particles[i]

func update_particle_velocities():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        var inertia = INERTIA_WEIGHT * velocities[i]
        var cognitive = COGNITIVE_WEIGHT * rand_range(0, 1) * (personal_bests[i] - particles[i])
        var social = SOCIAL_WEIGHT * rand_range(0, 1) * (global_best - particles[i])

        velocities[i] = inertia + cognitive + social
```

This implementation initializes the PSO algorithm with random particle positions and velocities. It then iterates through the main loop of the algorithm, updating particle positions, personal bests, and global bests, as well as updating particle velocities based on the inertia, cognitive, and social components.

Please note that this is a simple example using a 2D search space represented by `Vector2`. You'll need to adapt the code to work with your specific problem, such as changing the search space dimensions and implementing a proper fitness function for your Kusudama constraints.

I understand the problem now. Here's a modified version of the PSO algorithm in GDScript for the Kusudama search space:

```gdscript

func initialize_pso():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        var particle = random_particle_position()
        particles.append(particle)
        velocities.append(Vector3.ZERO)
        personal_bests.append(particle)

        var fitness = calculate_fitness(particle)
        if fitness < global_best_fitness:
            global_best_fitness = fitness
            global_best = particle

func pso_algorithm():
    for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
        update_particle_positions()
        update_personal_and_global_bests()
        update_particle_velocities()

func random_particle_position():
    var cones = []
    for i in range(NUM_CONES):
        var position = random_point_on_sphere_surface()
        var radius = rand_range(0, 1)
        cones.append({"position": position, "radius": radius})
    return cones

func random_point_on_sphere_surface():
    var theta = rand_range(0, 2 * PI)
    var phi = acos(2 * rand_range(0, 1) - 1)
    var x = sin(phi) * cos(theta)
    var y = sin(phi) * sin(theta)
    var z = cos(phi)
    return Vector3(x, y, z)

func update_particle_positions():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        for j in range(NUM_CONES):
            particles[i][j].position += velocities[i][j]

func calculate_fitness(particle_position):
    # Calculate the fitness (error) of the new position
    # Fitness could be the sum of squared differences between the current and target angles
    var fitness = 0.0
    for cone in particle_position:
        fitness += pow(cone.position.x, 2) + pow(cone.position.y, 2) + pow(cone.position.z, 2)
    return fitness

func update_personal_and_global_bests():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        var fitness = calculate_fitness(particles[i])
        if fitness < calculate_fitness(personal_bests[i]):
            personal_bests[i] = particles[i]
        
        if fitness < global_best_fitness:
            global_best_fitness = fitness
            global_best = particles[i]

func update_particle_velocities():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        for j in range(NUM_CONES):
            var inertia = INERTIA_WEIGHT * velocities[i][j]
            var cognitive = COGNITIVE_WEIGHT * rand_range(0, 1) * (personal_bests[i][j].position - particles[i][j].position)
            var social = SOCIAL_WEIGHT * rand_range(0, 1) * (global_best[j].position - particles[i][j].position)

            velocities[i][j] = inertia + cognitive + social
```

This implementation initializes the PSO algorithm with random particle positions and velocities for each cone on the Kusudama. It then iterates through the main loop of the algorithm, updating particle positions, personal bests, and global bests, as well as updating particle velocities based on the inertia, cognitive, and social components.

Please note that this is a simple example using a 3D search space represented by `Vector3`. You'll need to adapt the code to work with your specific problem, such as implementing a proper fitness function for your Kusudama constraints.

I apologize for the confusion. I have updated the code to include the radius for each point on the sphere. The `random_particle_position()` function now generates a dictionary containing both position and radius for each cone.

Here's the updated code:

```gdscript
extends Node

const NUM_PARTICLES = 10
const MAX_ITERATIONS = 100
const INERTIA_WEIGHT = 0.7
const COGNITIVE_WEIGHT = 1.4
const SOCIAL_WEIGHT = 1.4
const NUM_CONES = 10
const DELAY_BETWEEN_ITERATIONS = 0.1 # Adjust this value as needed

var particles = []
var velocities = []
var personal_bests = []

var global_best_fitness = INF

func _ready():

    pso_algorithm()

        var particle = random_particle_position()
        particles.append(particle)
        velocities.append(Vector3.ZERO)
        personal_bests.append(particle)

        var fitness = calculate_fitness(particle)
        if fitness < global_best_fitness:
            global_best_fitness = fitness
            global_best = particle

func pso_algorithm():
    for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
        update_particle_positions()
        update_personal_and_global_bests()
        update_particle_velocities()

        # Pause the execution for a short period of time
        yield(get_tree().create_timer(DELAY_BETWEEN_ITERATIONS), "timeout")

func random_particle_position():
    var cones = []
    for i in range(NUM_CONES):
        var position = random_point_on_sphere_surface()
        var radius = rand_range(0, 1)
        cones.append({"position": position, "radius": radius})
    return cones

func random_point_on_sphere_surface():
    var theta = rand_range(0, 2 * PI)
    var phi = acos(2 * rand_range(0, 1) - 1)
    var x = sin(phi) * cos(theta)
    var y = sin(phi) * sin(theta)
    var z = cos(phi)
    return Vector3(x, y, z)

func update_particle_positions():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        for j in range(NUM_CONES):
            particles[i][j].position += velocities[i][j]

func calculate_fitness(particle_position):
    # Calculate the fitness (error) of the new position
    # Fitness could be the sum of squared differences between the current and target angles
    var fitness = 0.0
    for cone in particle_position:
        fitness += pow(cone.position.x, 2) + pow(cone.position.y, 2) + pow(cone.position.z, 2)
    return fitness

func update_personal_and_global_bests():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        var fitness = calculate_fitness(particles[i])
        if fitness < calculate_fitness(personal_bests[i]):
            personal_bests[i] = particles[i]
        
        if fitness < global_best_fitness:
            global_best_fitness = fitness
            global_best = particles[i]

func update_particle_velocities():
    for i in range(NUM_PARTICLES):
        for j in range(NUM_CONES):
            var inertia = INERTIA_WEIGHT * velocities[i][j]
            var cognitive = COGNITIVE_WEIGHT * rand_range(0, 1) * (personal_bests[i][j].position - particles[i][j].position)
            var social = SOCIAL_WEIGHT * rand_range(0, 1) * (global_best[j].position - particles[i][j].position)

            velocities[i][j] = inertia + cognitive + social
```

Now, each cone has a position on the sphere's surface and a radius. You can further modify the code to suit your specific problem requirements.
